Development at our door steps
My Name is Umar Sale a student of NITDA BLOCKCHAIN SCHOLARSHIP, I would like to express my appreciation to the stakeholders of this great program for their efforts to run this program fluently. Within the program , I was able to participate in different courses taken in this programme right from introduction to Bitcoin Theory to Bitcoin Enterprises and now moving to another phase of it. By the way I comes to understand that in this programme I am digitally matured and bold enough to be a great Bitcoin accelerator in order to help part of my community and the world so far to be familiar with the word (Bitcoin) and how it goes against visible money or banking system errors. I will be glad to share my experience on This Topic : THE VISIBLE SOLUTION AND THE BLIND DEVELOPERS. Which can actually change the mind of the youths in other to builds a world of happiness and excitement without a hindrance or interference in development sections by:
. securing the lives and property of our community.
. Showing ways of avoiding fake news 
. Delivering of social inter personal skills to youths through making happiness and excitement within the ecosystem
. Given a sound Education about how Internet of things is.
. showing the right place to waste time within the Digital world of ours

I hope my applicable topic will be fully observed and mentored by our GLOBAL BLOCKCHAIN COMPANY in other to maintain right attitude towards networking and BLOCKCHAIN ecosystem.
